# Profiling
Profiling is the process of measuring the performance characteristics of a program, such as CPU usage, memory consumption, and execution time. It helps developers identify bottlenecks, inefficient code paths, and resource leaks.

## Profiling in Go

Go provides built-in support for profiling via the `runtime/pprof` and `net/http/pprof` packages.

### Types of Profiles

- **CPU Profiling:** Measures where CPU time is spent.
- **Memory Profiling:** Tracks memory allocations.
- **Block Profiling:** Detects goroutine blocking events.
- **Mutex Profiling:** Finds lock contention.

### How to Use
TODO: Implement

### Tools

- [pprof](https://github.com/google/pprof): Visualization and analysis tool for Go profiles.
- [GoDoc: net/http/pprof](https://pkg.go.dev/net/http/pprof): Official documentation.
